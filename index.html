      <h1>Project Team 3: Buses, DS 4200 F19</h1>
      
      <p><strong>Justin Delano</strong>, <strong>Adam Poole</strong>, <strong>Thandiwe Tembo</strong></p>
      
      <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>
      
      
      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      
      <p>Our project aims to clearly measure and show the possible benefits of removing all of the possible delays from the bus route through the Chester Square Neighborhood. This project hopes to give the MBTA good reasons for why improvements in the bus routes are needed, as well as informing the residents of the neighborhood about how their daily lives would be affected. With these goals in mind, we hope to be able to ensure that all stakeholders of possible bus route improvements are informed about the reasons why an improvement project is necessary. One main goal is to specifically help the Chester Square Neighborhood Association convince other neighborhood associations to partner up to push for a bus improvement project. This will be accomplished through a series of interactive visualizations that focus on three different scenarios. The main focus will be on how a separate bus lane throughout Route 1 will have the most benefit for the project stakeholders.</p>
      
      <h1>Visualization</h1>
      
      <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>
      
    </div>
    
    <!-- Your visualization here -->
    <div class="vis-holder">
      <!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->    
      <!-- Delete all the sample SVG code below after the viewbox to before the closing tag. Populate this part of the SVG with D3. -->
      <svg id="vis-svg" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000"> 
      
      <!-- Don't delete the closing tag! -->
      </svg>
    <div id="mapid" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>

      <h1>Demo Video</h1>
      
      <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>
      
      <video controls width="100%">
        <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
         a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
      </video>

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
      
      <p><em>final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

	  <p> The primary function of our visualization is to allow users to discover more about the Route 1 bus, and its possible improvements. Our main goal was to show the predicted benefits of a "reliable" bus, by showing comparisons between different trasffic scenarios. Furthermore, we wanted to be able to have these visualizations be customizable, to allow users to select their own commutes on Route 1, and directly see the impact of a reliable bus personally. </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      
      <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
      Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
      Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
